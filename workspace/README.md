# Welcome to AutoMinds Studios
"*The Factory for Sovereign Intelligence*"

You are now inside a secure, sovereign development environment.
This Studio is designed to help you **Build, Wrap, and Sell** AI agents.

## Getting Started

### 1. Build Your Agent
Use the pre-installed VS Code extensions (Python, Node, AI Companion) to write your agent's code.
Recommended File Structure:
- `agent.py` (Main logic)
- `requirements.txt` (Dependencies)

### 2. The Analyst Companion
Open the "Continue" extension in the sidebar (or press `Cmd+L`) to chat with **The Analyst**. 
It is connected to your codebase and can help generate code safely.

### 3. Wrap & Ship
When your agent is ready, open the terminal and run:

    am-deploy

This will:
- [x] Scan for dependencies
- [x] Run a security audit (Sentry)
- [x] Package your code into a Docker container
- [x] Generate a Commercial License Key
